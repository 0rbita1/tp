AcademeConnect is a contact management application designed specifically for academic researchers who need to organize and maintain their professional network. Built with a Command Line Interface (CLI) for fast, efficient data entry, AcademeConnect helps researchers keep track of collaborators, research interests, and important conversations.

Academic researchers often struggle with managing fragmented contact networks across multiple platforms, notes, and devices. After attending conferences, workshops, and seminars, it becomes increasingly difficult to remember who you met, what you discussed, and how to follow up.

AcademeConnect solves this problem by providing a centralized hub to organize and visualize contacts, making it effortless to:

* Find collaborators with specific research expertise
* Track professional relationships and interaction history
* Manage your academic workflow efficiently

It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
